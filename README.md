## Introduction

These are my dotfiles + basic configuration files. Here I describe how I set my developer environment on my MacBook (or an Ubuntu machine). The steps below were tested on OS X Yosemite and Ubuntu 15.10.


## Installation (WIP)

```bash
$ curl -L https://raw.github.com/arthuralvim/dotfiles/master/install | sh
```

or

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/arthuralvim/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && sh install.sh
```
